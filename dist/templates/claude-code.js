# m-notes — Your Wiki (MANDATORY)

**Server**: ${opts.url}
**Workspace**: ${opts.workspaceId}

> **Division of labour**: The human curates sources and asks questions. You do the grunt work — summarising, cross-referencing, filing, bookkeeping. You are the **author and maintainer of a living wiki**. Every session, three things compound: the wiki grows, links densify, contradictions get resolved. This is your persistent memory — without it you start from zero every conversation.

## Workspace Resolution

The CLI resolves workspace automatically — no \`--workspace-id\` flag needed. Resolution order:

1. \`MNOTES_WORKSPACE_ID\` environment variable
2. Per-directory mapping set by \`mnotes workspace link\` (walks up parent dirs)
3. Global default set by \`mnotes workspace select\`

To configure: run \`mnotes workspace link\` in your project directory, or set \`MNOTES_WORKSPACE_ID\` in your shell environment.

## The Three Layers

1. **Raw sources** — user messages, pasted docs, URLs, files. Immutable. You never edit these.
2. **The wiki** — your notes. You *write* these. They are interlinked with \`[[wikilinks]]\`, tagged for retrieval, and updated whenever sources change.
3. **The schema** — notes tagged \`type:config\` (or in a \`_schema/\` folder). The user's rules for how the wiki is organized. **Read these before editing the wiki.**

## Page Types (for long-form wiki notes)

When creating a note, use the most specific \`type\` from this enum in frontmatter:

| type | Use when... |
|------|-------------|
| \`concept\` | A recurring idea, pattern, or principle |
| \`entity\` | A person, library, product, or system |
| \`source-summary\` | A distilled summary of one raw source |
| \`comparison\` | A side-by-side of two or more entities/concepts |
| \`overview\` | A top-down map of a topic area |

These types apply to **wiki notes** (long-form, evolving pages). They are distinct from kb-store fast-capture categories (see "When to Store Knowledge" below).

### Recommended Frontmatter

Follow this convention when creating or updating notes:

\`\`\`yaml
---
title: <human-readable>
type: concept | entity | source-summary | comparison | overview
sources: [<raw source ids or slugs>]
related: [<linked note titles>]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
confidence: high | medium | low
---
\`\`\`

This frontmatter is a convention, not enforced by the server. Agents and humans rely on it for provenance and navigation — always populate it.

## Rules (follow strictly)

1. **ALWAYS recall before researching.** Before exploring the codebase or making assumptions — run \`mnotes kb recall\` and \`mnotes note search\`. Past you already figured things out.
2. **ALWAYS store what you learn.** Non-obvious discoveries → \`mnotes kb store\` immediately. Anything worth re-finding belongs in the wiki.
3. **LOG MEANINGFUL SESSIONS.** Run \`mnotes session log --summary "..."\` before ending — only when real work happened, and only with a real summary (decisions, actions, or a concrete outcome). Skip the log for trivial / read-only sessions; never call \`session log\` with a stub summary like "Session ended".
4. **ALWAYS load context at session start.** Run \`mnotes composite project-load\`. Use \`mnotes session resume\` if mid-conversation.
5. **INGEST sources coherently.** When the user drops a URL, long paste, or file: don't just dump it into one note. Run the **ingest loop** (below).
6. **LINT the wiki periodically.** On session start for large workspaces, and after any ingest, run the **lint loop** (below).
7. **READ schema before editing.** Before creating or updating notes, run \`mnotes note search --query type:config\`. Follow their conventions. If none exist, offer to create a starter schema note.
8. **EVERY note must link.** Outbound \`[[wikilinks]]\` are mandatory — an orphan note is invisible.

## Non-Negotiable Checklist

These are not suggestions. Skip any step and the wiki degrades.

### Session Start (before ANY work)
- [ ] Run \`mnotes wiki log tail --limit 10\` — see recent ingest/lint/decision activity before anything else
- [ ] Read the Wiki Index: \`mnotes note-ops by-title --title "Wiki Index"\` — find relevant pages and drill in before falling back to search
- [ ] Run \`mnotes composite project-load\`
- [ ] Run \`mnotes kb recall --query "<topic>"\` — past you already figured things out
- [ ] Run \`mnotes note search --query "<topic>"\` for related wiki pages
- [ ] If the graph is empty, run \`mnotes graph populate\` (idempotent)
- [ ] Run \`mnotes note search --query "type:config"\` for schema notes before editing

Do not skip this. Do not say "I'll check later." Do not assume you know what's in the wiki.

### During Work (every time you learn something)
- [ ] Non-obvious discovery? → \`mnotes kb store\` immediately, do not batch
- [ ] User drops a URL/paste/file? → run the **ingest loop** (below), not a single note dump
- [ ] Made an architecture or design decision? → store with key \`arch/{component}\`
- [ ] Fixed a bug? → store with key \`bug/{id}\`, include root cause
- [ ] Found a gotcha or footgun? → store with key \`gotcha/{description}\`
- [ ] User corrected you or clarified a requirement? → store it

### What NOT to Store
- Trivial changes (typo fixes, formatting)
- Information obvious from reading the code
- Duplicates — run \`mnotes kb recall\` first to check

### Session End (before finishing)
- [ ] If meaningful work happened (decisions, code shipped, investigations completed): run \`mnotes session log --summary "<real summary>"\` with concrete content. Skip otherwise — empty/stub logs are noise.
- [ ] If you did meaningful work and didn't store anything yet — you forgot. Go back and store it.

If you think "this isn't worth saving" — save it anyway. Future you has no context.

## The Ingest Loop

When the user supplies a source (URL, paste, file):

1. **Find related pages**: \`mnotes note search\` + \`mnotes graph query\` to identify **10–15 existing notes** affected. A single non-trivial source typically touches 10–15 pages, not 3 — if you find fewer, search harder.
2. **Plan the edits**: which existing notes need \`mnotes note-ops append\` / \`mnotes note update\`, which new notes need \`mnotes note create\`, and what \`[[wikilinks]]\` connect them.
3. **Apply**: execute the plan. Every touched note gets:
   - A \`source/<slug>\` tag **and** a "Sources" section in the body listing provenance
   - At least one \`[[wikilink]]\` to another touched note
   - Frontmatter updated (especially \`updated\`, \`sources\`, \`related\`)
4. **Summarize**: tell the user which notes were created vs. updated.
5. **Log the ingest**: the PostToolUse hook appends the log entry automatically when you run \`mnotes notes create\` / \`mnotes wiki ingest\`. You do not need to call \`wiki log append\` manually — the hook handles it.
6. **Refresh the index**: \`mnotes wiki index refresh\`

A single source touching fewer than 5 notes is a red flag — that's a sign you're treating the wiki as a dumping ground rather than a connected graph.

## The Query Loop

When answering a non-trivial question:

1. **Search first**: \`mnotes note search --query "<question terms>"\` + \`mnotes kb recall --query "<question terms>"\`.
2. **Answer from the wiki**: synthesise from what you find. Prefer existing notes over re-deriving from scratch.
3. **File non-trivial answers back**: if the answer required real synthesis or isn't already a note, create one (use the appropriate page type: \`concept\`, \`overview\`, etc.). This is the compounding loop — answering questions grows the wiki.
4. **Log the query**: the PostToolUse hook appends the log entry automatically when you run \`mnotes search\` / \`mnotes recall-knowledge\`. You do not need to call \`wiki log append\` manually — the hook handles it.

Questions answered and not filed are knowledge lost.

## The Lint Loop

Periodically (session start on large workspaces; after ingests):

- **Contradictions** → run \`mnotes kb scan-conflicts\`. Resolve, don't stack.
- **Orphans** → \`mnotes graph query-note\` for notes with zero inbound or outbound links. Link them or delete.
- **Broken wikilinks** → \`[[X]]\` targets that don't exist. Create a stub note or fix the link.
- **Stale** → notes untouched >90 days referenced by new sources. Update them.

After running \`mnotes wiki lint\`, the PostToolUse hook appends the log entry automatically. You do not need to call \`wiki log append\` manually — the hook handles it. Call \`mnotes wiki log append --kind decision\` only for explicit decisions, which no hook can infer.

Report findings as a short list; ask before bulk-deleting.

## When to Store Knowledge

Store **proactively** — don't wait to be asked. These are **kb-store fast-capture categories** (distinct from wiki note page types above):

- Architecture decision → \`arch/{component}\`
- Code pattern or convention → \`pattern/{name}\`
- Debugged bug → \`bug/{id}\`
- Dependency quirk → \`dep/{package}\`
- Product/tech decision → \`decision/{topic}\`
- Domain understanding → \`context/{area}\`
- Gotcha or footgun → \`gotcha/{description}\`
- Completed task → \`task/{id}\`

**Promotion rule**: if a knowledge entry is recalled 3+ times, promote it to a full wiki note with \`mnotes note create\`. Use the page-type vocabulary when promoting: a recurring pattern becomes a \`concept\` note, a library/tool becomes an \`entity\` note, a summarised investigation becomes a \`source-summary\`, etc.

## When to Recall Knowledge

Recall **before acting**:
- Tech decision → recall \`arch/*\` + \`decision/*\`
- Touching a module → recall \`pattern/*\` + \`context/*\`
- Debugging → recall \`bug/*\` for similar past issues
- Adding a dependency → recall \`dep/*\`
- Session start → run \`mnotes composite project-load\` (automatic via SessionStart hook)
- User asks about past work → run \`mnotes session resume\`

## Notes vs. Knowledge Entries

In the wiki model, **notes are primary**. Knowledge entries are fast-capture for things that haven't earned a page yet.

| Use a **note** when... | Use \`mnotes kb store\` when... |
|---|---|
| Content is long-form or evolving | Content is a single fact |
| Needs \`[[wikilinks]]\` and backlinks | Key/tag retrieval is enough |
| Subject will be referenced repeatedly | One-shot capture |
| Meeting notes, investigations, design docs | Architecture decisions, gotchas |

**When in doubt, create a note.**

### Note Creation
- **Meetings / planning** → \`mnotes note create\`
- **Investigations** → \`mnotes note create\` then \`mnotes note-ops append\` as you go
- **Design / architecture** → full notes, not just knowledge entries
- **Task summaries** → after completing a story
- **Daily captures** → \`mnotes note-ops daily\`

### Note Maintenance
- \`mnotes note-ops append\` — add progress
- \`mnotes note update\` — supersede stale content
- \`mnotes tag manage\` — keep notes findable

## Knowledge Graph — Non-Optional

The graph is how the wiki stays navigable. **Every note you write or edit must have at least one outbound wikilink.**

### When to Build
- **Session start**: run \`mnotes graph populate\` if the graph is empty (idempotent).
- **Architecture decisions**: create concept nodes, link with \`related\` / \`parent\`.
- **Dependency discovery**: create nodes for packages, link to components using them.
- **Bug investigations**: link bug nodes to affected components/patterns.
- **Any A↔B relationship**: create the edge. The graph compounds.
